# Mood++

## Motivation
On May 9, 2021, while attending the UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp during the COVID-19 pandemic, my classmate Cody Callahan and I were assigned to a team and asked to create an app that accepts user input and delivers a response. It was the first of three projects in the 6-month camp. Our app idea was, given the unprecedented circumstances surrounding COVID, our app would enhance the world's mood, one click at a time.

## Features
The Mood++ app takes user input (whether the user is feeling happy or meh) and delivers either a joke to further enhance the user's happy mood, or an inspirational quote to enhance a user's meh mood). The last joke and inspirational image are saved in local storage.

## APIs
The app uses the JokeAPI v2 (https://rapidapi.com/Sv443/api/jokeapi-v2) and the (NEW as of June, 2025) ZenQuotes (https://zenquotes.io/) APIs. (FYI: The previous inspirational quote image stopped working thus this new build: Universal Inspirational Quotes (https://rapidapi.com/HealThruWords/api/universal-inspirational-quotes). 

## Tech Used
In addition to the APIs and GitHub, the app uses HTML, CSS, JavaScipt, and Bulma

## Roadmap (Future Development)
Future plans include:
* Making the updated "meh" inspirational action responsive
* Giving the user the option to disable "safe-mode" on the Joke API
* Making the white boxes (Bulma styling) appear with the joke, not ahead of the joke
* Saving the last quote image into localStorage to appear by default the next time you start the app
* Resizing and better aligning the joke boxes and quote boxes for an improved aesthetic
