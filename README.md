# Mood++

## Motivation
Given today's unprecedented circumstances, we wanted to create an app to enhance the world's mood, one click at a time

## Features
The Mood++ app takes user input (whether the user is feeling happy or meh) and delivers either a joke to further enhance the user's happy mood, or an image with inspirational quotes to enhance a user's meh mood). The last joke and inspirational image are saved in local storage.

## APIs
The app uses the JokeAPI v2 (https://rapidapi.com/Sv443/api/jokeapi-v2) and the Universal Inspirational Quotes (https://rapidapi.com/HealThruWords/api/universal-inspirational-quotes) APIs.

## Tech Used
In addition to the APIs and GitHub, the app uses HTML, CSS, JavaScipt, and Bulma

## Roadmap (Future Development)
Future plans include:
* Giving the user the option to disable "safe-mode" on the Joke API
* Making the white boxes (Bulma styling) appear with the joke, not ahead of the joke
* Saving the last quote image into localStorage to appear by default the next time you start the app
* Resizing and better aligning the joke boxes and quote boxes for an improved aesthetic
